  "readme": "# sublime-tabs\n\nThis enables sublime-style tabs in Atom.\n\nNormally, the Tabs package will open a new tab for each file, and it will stay open even if you don't edit it.\n\nsublime-tabs enables you to click a file through the Tree View on the left, it will open it as a \"temp\" file like sublime does,\nand will close the tab if another tab is opened without you editing it.\n\n![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddavison/sublime-tabs/master/images/example.gif)\n\n## To Use\nInstall either through the Atom package search, or by:\n```sh\n$ apm install sublime-tabs\n```\n\nThis is a replacement for the `Tabs` and `Tree View` package.  Open your Settings, and disable both the `Tabs` and `Tree View` package by searching for it and clicking \"Disable\" on them.\nIf you don't do this, you will see multiple tree or tab views.\n\n## If for some reason...\nsublime-tabs is not working... try:\n* Making sure sublime-tabs is installed, enabled, and up to date\n* Making sure the `Tabs` package is disabled.\n* Making sure the `Tree View` package is disabled.\n* Restart Atom\n* Right click somewhere in an open file, and click `Reveal in tree view`\n\n## Uninstall\nThis is an early version, so it *may* screw things up.  If it does, you can re-enable `Tabs` and `Tree View`, and disable `sublime-tabs`.\n\n",
